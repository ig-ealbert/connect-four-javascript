# Connect Four Game in JavaScript

This is the Connect Four game implemented in TypeScript/Next.js with tests written in Jest.

The game provides a 6 x 7 grid. The goal of each player is to create a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of length 4. Turns alternate, so you have to both plan your strategy to win, as well as defend against your opponent.
