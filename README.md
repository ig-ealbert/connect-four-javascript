# Connect Four Game in JavaScript

This is the Connect Four game implemented in TypeScript/Next.js with tests written in Jest.

The game provides a 6 x 7 grid. The goal of each player is to create a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of length 4. Turns alternate, so you have to both plan your strategy to win, as well as defend against your opponent.

## Running the Game

```
npm run dev
```

To place a token, click on the top-most row in the column you want. Hovering over a slot on the top row will change it to the color of the current player to indicate you can drop a token there. Black goes first.

## Running the Unit Tests

```
npm test
```
